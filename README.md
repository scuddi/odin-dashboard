# Odin Admin Dashboard

This is the Admin Dashboard project of the The Odin Project. (See: [Project: Admin Dashboard](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard))
In this project the aim is to build a an Admin Dashboard to apply the learned basic and more advanced knowledge on **CSS-Grid**.
As this chapter was about CSS-Grid, I've only used grid and didn't combine it with CSS-Flex for practising reasons.

The given template from the project can be seen here: [Click here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png)
